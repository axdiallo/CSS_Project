Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am not able to directly create files or modify existing projects. However, I can provide you with the necessary steps to complete the task:

Create a new file named styles.css in the same directory as your HTML file.
In your HTML file, add the following line to link the stylesheet to your HTML document:
bash
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
To change the display of the navbar to inline, add the following code to your styles.css file:
css
Copy code
nav {
  display: inline;
}
To change the font to Roboto, add the following code to your styles.css file:
css
Copy code
body {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
Note that you will need to import the Roboto font into your HTML file. You can do this by adding the following code to the <head> section of your HTML file:
perl
Copy code
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300;400;500;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
To add classes attributes to HTML documents, simply add the class attribute to the HTML tag that you want to apply the class to, like so:
csharp
Copy code
<div class="my-class">This div has the class "my-class".</div>
You can then define the styles for the class in your styles.css file, like so:
css
Copy code
.my-class {
  background-color: #F00;
  color: #FFF;
}
As for being creative, the sky is the limit! You can experiment with different colors, fonts, layouts, and design elements to create a unique and eye-catching portfolio. Don't be afraid to try new things and think outside the box! And if you need inspiration, you can always search online for portfolio templates or examples.
